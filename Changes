This file documents the revision history for Perl extension Text::MultiMarkdown.

1.0.0   2006-08-22T00:00:00
        - first release

1.0.1   2006-10-20T00:00:00
        - include patch from Uwe Voelker to allow setting of options in
          markdown(); also added a test case from Uwe. Thanks, Uwe!
          Also updated changelog references in POD somewhat.

1.0.2   2007-11-24T14:00:00
        - move to Module::Install and clean various things up, mostly to make
          CPANTS happy.

1.0.3   2007-11-24T20:22:00
        - way to keep me accountable, CPANTESTERS! Maybe I shouldn't have
          Test::Pod::Coverage enabled unless it actually checks out. Added some
          fairly useless stubbed METHODS to POD and moved POD around a bit.
          
1.0.4   2008-01-02T02:03:50
        - Refactor so that the processor instance has the same set of        
          persistent options as on the ->markdown method itself.
        - Change all functions to be instance methods, moved a chunk of the 
          global data to the instance. The rest will follow shortly.
        - The test suite now tests a reasonable set of the Markdown and 
          MultiMarkdown syntaxes.
        - All known options and metadata keys have been documented.
        
1.0.5   2008-01-04T18:07:57
        - Add Markdown and MultiMarkdown test suites.
        - Fix a big bug introduced in 1.0.4 in citations
        - Fix footnotes (and other small things) to match the test suite
        
1.0.6   2008-01-06T13:36:00
        - Merge latest Markdown test suite I can find, and make it all pass, 
          pulling in code from Markdown 1.0.2b8. Things fixed:
            - Inline HTML
            - Lists
            - Metadata skipping by leading line breaks
            - 3rd form of links
        - Implement features to suppress id attributes in <img> and <hX> tags 
          to be able to act more like original Markdown - now almost ready to
          steal Text::Markdown (would want to turn off tables / citations and
          bibliography for that)
        - Move almost all the global variables into instance data.
        - Fix unicode issues from CPAN.org's RT#27482
        - Remove call to srand, it's not smart to do this more than once.
        
1.0.7   2008-01-07T16:31:00
        - Encode isn't in core in all perls, add it to Makefile.PL

1.0.8  2008-01-22T19:20:00
        - Do not encode amps or angle brackets in HTML comments + test case. 
        - Do not emit title attribute in <img> tags unless we have contents 
          for it. This was a 'feature' of original Markdown where I've decided 
          to go with what php-markdown does (tests updated).
        - Added php-markdown tests (most/all of the regular tests pass except 
          the email obfu one).
        - Added php-markdown extra tests (all fail).
        - Added python markdown tests (mostly pass, but marked broken).
        - Add a way of stopping inline HTML blocks from suppressing markdown    
          processing. Feature request from #catalyst-dev 

1.0.9  2008-01-22T20:28:00
        - Ship non-broken dist at CPAN (oops, rushing!)

1.0.10 2008-01-23T15:40:00
        - Fix bug with links processing in HTML blocks.

1.0.11 2008-01-24T00:12:00
        - Fix syntax error in one of the tests. Note to self - just fixing 
          that warning in the test case, then shipping without retesting, NOT 
          SMART!
          
1.0.12 2008-02-18T22:00:00
        - Text::Markdown - borgborgborgborgborg.
        - Added additional POD documentation.
        - Cleaned up some tests, and some additional test cases.
        - Options to turn off all the extra features introduced in 
          MultiMarkdown.
        
1.0.13 2008-02-19T23:54:33
       - Due to the UFT8 support this module no longer works on perl <
         5.8, note this in the Makefile.PL and modules.
       - I managed to ship a module without Makefile.PL, WTF? Really
         need to start using ShipIt.

1.0.14 2008-02-21T22:41:33
       - Fix a bug in the packaging of the last version.
       - Add links to other implementations and some notes about them.
       - Add a (failing) unit test for some unexpected behavior reported on 
         the list.

1.0.15 2008-02-23T11:13:07
       - Start using ShipIt to package the distribution.

1.0.16 2008-02-25T14:24:00
       - Fix bugs with tab_width in constructor / as an option.
       - Fix bugs with tab width in pre/code blocks.
       
1.0.17 2008-03-17T??:??:??
       - Add Markdown.pl and MultiMarkdown.pl, which work the same way as the 
         original Markdown.pl. These scripts *are not* installed by default, 
         but you will be prompted to install them when you run Makefile.PL
          
       - Make _DeTab significantly quicker. Text::Balanced is still the main
         performance sore point however. :(
       
       - Re-organise the module code so that Text::Markdown is a standalone 
         module which does not require Text::MultiMarkdown.     
         Text::MultiMarkdown now inherits from Text::Markdown and adds the
         additional MultiMarkdown functionality. This is a *large* change to
         the module's internals, but is much more in the spirit of the 
         original Markdown project (and should silence most complaints about 
         how the code works, and possible even stop John Gruber hating my 
         guts).
         
         If you were using Text::Markdown previously, but relying on an 
         implicit MultiMarkdown feature, this *could be a breaking change*.
       
         Detailed description of any possible user visible changes below:
         
         - Text::Markdown will no longer supports the additional attribute 
           specification for images and links feature, which was not in 
           original Markdown, but were previously supported after
           the code merge of Text::Markdown and Text::MultiMarkdown.

           If you are relying on this features, it is recommended that you 
           use Text::MultiMarkdown (configured as you prefer), as this is 
           not a supported feature in the original Markdown.

         - Text::MultiMarkdown has changed the order of attributes in image 
           tags, the id attribute is moved from the first to the last 
           attribute (barring user supplied attributes). An example of the 
           expected change is included below:

           Old output:  <img id="image" src="http://path.to/image" alt="image" title="Image title" width="40px" height="400px" />

           New output: <img src="http://path.to/image" alt="image" title="Image title" id="image" width="40px" height="400px" />
         
           This is due to the code re-organisation, moving the id attribute 
           around shouldn't affect anything that isn't relying on the 
           attribute ordering (which is meant to be unimportant in HTML), and 
           allows for simplification of the unified code.
